StencilJs. Components and Tests playground

This project was made in educational purposes. A button "Add .gitignore: None" was taken as an example from site https://github.com/new

Were made these components:

	ArrowIcon
	DefaultButton
	OptionList
	ListOption item
	PopupWindow
	Text

Filtration works, click on someoption will change button title.
